soccentric yocto will be  cornerstone of our hardware enablement strategy.
Lead Yocto Development: Architect, maintain, and enhance our core Yocto Project build system and associated layers (BSPs).
Vendor Onboarding: Serve as the primary technical liaison for strategic SoC and SoM vendors. Guide them through the process of creating and validating their BSP layers
BSP Integration & Maintenance: Develop, integrate, and maintain Board Support Packages (BSPs) for a diverse range of hardware platforms. Troubleshoot and resolve complex build and runtime issues related to hardware integration.
System Architecture: Collaborate with the core engineering team to define hardware abstraction layers (HALs) and ensure consistency across our supported hardware portfolio.
Upstream Contribution: Drive contributions to the upstream Yocto Project and other relevant open-source communities to benefit both Avocado Linux and our partners.
Tooling & Automation: Develop and improve CI/CD pipelines and automated testing frameworks to ensure the quality and reliability of all hardware-specific builds.
Extensive Yocto Experience: 20+ years of hands-on experience with the Yocto Project is essential. You should have a deep understanding of bitbake, recipes, classes, and layer creation/management.
Embedded Linux Guru: Proven expertise in low-level Linux development, including the kernel, bootloaders (U-Boot), device trees, and device drivers.
SoC/SoM Integration: Demonstrable experience working with various SoC architectures (e.g., ARM, RISC-V) and integrating BSPs from major silicon vendors.
Programming Proficiency: Strong programming skills in C/C++ and scripting languages like Python and Bash.
CI/CD & DevOps: Experience with modern CI/CD tools (e.g., GitLab CI, Jenkins) and containerization technologies (e.g., Docker).
Collaboration: Excellent communication and interpersonal skills, with the ability to work effectively with external partners and internal teams.
Problem-Solving: A proactive and analytical approach to identifying and solving complex technical challenges.
Lead Embedded Linux Engineer  you will own the design and development of a custom Linux distribution built with Yocto. You will work with a number of internal stakeholders to: derive requirements, plan and execute the development of the distribution, test the distribution on prototypes in a lab environment, deploy over-the-air updates, and eventually grow a team dedicated to this work.
We build spacecraft fast! So, the perfect candidate for this role will have significant previous experience designing, developing, and testing software on rapid timelines. We are looking for engineers that enjoy a challenge and have a track record of creative thinking to solve unconventional problems.
