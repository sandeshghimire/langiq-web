            challenge="A state government agency was struggling with overwhelming call volumes, long wait times, and inconsistent information delivery across different departments. Citizens were frustrated by the complexity of accessing government services, forms were frequently submitted with errors causing processing delays, and multilingual support was limited. Service staff were spending most of their time answering routine questions rather than handling complex cases."
            solution="We developed a comprehensive virtual assistant using langiq's AI Studio that guides citizens through government services across multiple departments. The system provides 24/7 support in multiple languages, helps users complete forms accurately, explains eligibility requirements and documentation needs, tracks application status, and seamlessly transfers to human agents for complex situations. It integrates with existing government databases while maintaining strict privacy and security controls."
