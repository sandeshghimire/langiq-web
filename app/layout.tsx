  description: "LangIQ is a universal framework for LLM application development, designed for startups, small, medium to large-scale companies to adopt AI, ML, and LLM workflow. We provide a state-of-the-art AI studio through which you can graphically develop AI applications, interface with frontier large language models from OpenAI, Google, Anthropic, DeepSeek, XAI and our local open source and open weight LLM such as LLAMA , DeepSeek, Geema, qwq, phi etc , . You can interface with local open-source and open-weight LLMs such as Meta LLAMA, DeepSeek, Microsoft PI, Alibaba QWN, etc. You can take your data and convert it into a vector database and work with local and frontier embeddings and use your data as knowledge bases. In addition, you can make local and frontier model knowledge by augmenting data using our state-of-the-art model augmentation. We do this by generating synthetic data based on your data. We provide state-of-the-art fine-tuning using Hugging Face transformer pipeline. Finally, using multiple agents, we provide agentic solutions to solve your unique needs. You can accomplish all this by using our state-of-the-art LangIQ AI studio. AI Studio from LangIQ can be customized for your needs, therefore it can be your own personal AI studio to solve your unique problems.
